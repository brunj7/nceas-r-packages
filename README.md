# Popular R packages

Hi Folks, 

we want to use the transition to R 4.0 as an opportunity to rethink how we manage R packages at the system level.

Please take few minutes to let us know the R packages you use frequently using the [issues](https://github.com/brunj7/nceas-r-packages/issues)

If the package you use is already entered, please add a 👍 to the issue.

Thanks!

NCEAS computing team
